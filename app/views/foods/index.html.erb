  <p class="text-justify">Peruvian cuisine reflects local practices and ingredients including influences mainly from the indigenous population, including the Inca, and cuisines brought by immigrants from Europe (Spanish cuisine, Italian cuisine, German cuisine); Asia (Japanese cuisine and Chinese cuisine); and Africa. Without the familiar ingredients from their home countries, immigrants modified their traditional cuisines by using ingredients available in Peru.</p>
  <p class="text-justify">The four traditional staples of Peruvian cuisine are corn, potatoes and other tubers, and Amaranthaceaes (quinoa, ka√±iwa and kiwicha) and legumes (beans and lupins). Staples brought by the Spanish include rice, wheat and meats (beef, pork and chicken).</p>
